Clan Sports is a **social network** that offers sports activities and showcases the achievements of children and
adolescents in order to connect them with sports institutions from an early age.

The company wants to provide parents, sports institutions, and families in general with the ability to verify the
performance, achievements, and recognition of children and adolescents through their effort. We believe that all
children and adolescents give their best to grow and enjoy their favorite sport, which is why it is important to make
their achievements known and support their growth.
